Gray Collar is an innovative job platform designed exclusively for senior citizens and retired professionals in India, addressing the growing need for post-retirement employment opportunities. With over 90% of Indian retirees lacking pension benefits and an aging population seeking financial independence and purpose, Gray Collar aims to bridge the gap between experienced talent and organizations that value wisdom.

Mission: Provide dignified, flexible employment opportunities for retired professionals while helping businesses leverage decades of expertise.

Vision: Transform retirement from an endpoint to a new beginning, creating India's most comprehensive ecosystem for senior employment.
Gray Collar is a job platform connecting retired professionals and senior citizens with meaningful, flexible work opportunities. Our mission is to empower retirees to continue contributing their skills while helping companies access experienced talent.
This project is an MVP built by a team of first-year students, focusing on creating a simple, user-friendly platform for both seniors and employers.
